*Basic Ideas:*
  
```
* hash --> password can not be directly read; 
           don't show information about password length etc.
* salt --> people cannot just generate hashcode dictionary for common password to do comparison directly;
           same password transfer to different hashcode for different user
* stretching --> to slow down offline attacks. 
                 (they can keep moving forwards for a hashcode or generate values for salt (from AA to ZZ)
```
  
*Steps:*
```
- Use a strong random number generator to create a salt of 16 bytes or longer. 
  (use CryptoAPI on Windows or /dev/urandom on Unix-like systems)

- Feed the salt and the password into the PBKDF2 algorithm.
  * Use HMAC-SHA-256 as the core hash inside PBKDF2. 
  (SHA-256 better than MD5 or SHA-1, since those proven giving same hash for 2 different data)
    a. take random key K; flip some bits, giving K1;
    b. compute SHA-256 hash for K1 + password, giving H1;
    c. flip a different set of bits in K, giving K2;
    d. compute SHA-256 hash for K2 + H1, giving final hash H2.  
  * Perform 80,000 iterations or more [March 2019].
   (Increase iteration count regularly to keep up with faster cracking tools)
  * Take 32 bytes (256 bits) of output from PBKDF2 as the final password hash.
  
- Store the iteration count, the salt and the final hash in your password database.
